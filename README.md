Inverse Over Current relays are probably the most widely used relays for over-current protection.
Historically IDMT , inverse definite minimum time characteristics is very frequently used inverse relay characteristics.
The definite minimum time part of the characteristics was the result of the electromagnetic stuructures used to implement the relay.
However, even in this digital age , the characteristics is retained because of the sheer number of electromehanical relays already installed.
